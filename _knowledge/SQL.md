### 1194. Tournament Winners
- 先找到所有人得分
- 再找每组排名第一的

~~~sql

### 1225. Report Contiguous Dates
- 取连续日趋：DAYOFYEAR(success_date) - row_number() over (order by success_date) as diff_dt -> group by
- 注意用DAYOFYEAR，否则月份断开

~~~sql
with temp as(
    select 'succeeded' as state, success_date as event_dt,
    DAYOFYEAR(success_date) - row_number() over (order by success_date) as diff_dt
    from succeeded
    where success_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
    union all
    select 'failed' as state, fail_date as event_dt,
    DAYOFYEAR(fail_date) - row_number() over (order by fail_date) as diff_dt
    from failed
    where fail_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
)

select state as period_state, min(event_dt) as start_date, max(event_dt) as end_date
from temp
group by state, diff_dt
order by start_date

### 1336. Number of Transactions per Visit
- 多个CTE with recursive写前面，即便不是所有CTE都是recursive

~~~sql
# 计算每人每次visit的transaction count
with recursive a as (
    select v.user_id, v.visit_date,
    if(t.transaction_date is null, 0, count(t.transaction_date)) as transactions_count
    from Visits v left join Transactions t
    on v.user_id = t.user_id
    and v.visit_date = t.transaction_date
    group by v.user_id, v.visit_date
),

# 计算相应transaction count的count
b as(
    select transactions_count, count(*) as visits_count
    from a
    group by transactions_count
),

# recursive CTE:生成0~n的连续数字
c as (
    select 0 as transactions_count
    union all
    select transactions_count + 1 from c where transactions_count < 
        (select max(transactions_count) from b)
)

select c.transactions_count, ifnull(b.visits_count, 0) as visits_count
from c left join b
on c.transactions_count =b.transactions_count

### 1369. Get the Second Most Recent Activity

~~~sql
with temp as

    select * ,
    rank() over (partition by username order by startDate desc) as activity_rank,
    count(activity) over (partition by username) as count_activity
    from UserActivity

select username, activity, startDate, endDate

### 1384. Total Sales Amount by Year

~~~sql
# 生成所有年份的start_date, end_date
WITH recursive yearsAll

### 1412. Find the Quiet Students in All Exams
- 正序rank一遍，倒序rank一遍
- 排除掉rank=1的学生

~~~sql

### 1479. Sales by Day of the Week   
- CTE先取出每天每个类别的数量 dayname()
- 再分成多列

~~~sql
# 每天每个类别的数量
with temp as(
    select dayname(o.order_date) as day, #使用dayname取day of week
    sum(o.quantity) as quant,
    i.item_category  as category

    on i.item_id = o.item_id
    group by day,  i.item_category
